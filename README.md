# How-to-set-custom-editor-for-properties-through-EditorAttribute-in-WPF-PropertyGrid
In WPF applications, the PropertyGrid control is a powerful tool for displaying and editing the properties of an object in a structured and user-friendly manner. One of its key features is the ability to assign custom editors to specific properties, allowing developers to enhance the editing experience beyond the default behavior. This customization is achieved through the use of the EditorAttribute, which enables you to specify a custom editor class for a property at design time.
To implement this, you define a custom editor that inherits from UITypeEditor and override its methods to provide the desired editing interface. Then, you apply the EditorAttribute to the property in your class, referencing the custom editor type. This approach allows you to replace standard text boxes with dropdowns, sliders, color pickers, or any other specialized UI elements that better suit the property's data type or intended use.
Using custom editors improves usability, ensures data consistency, and provides a more intuitive interface for end users. Itâ€™s especially useful in scenarios where properties require constrained input or visual selection. The EditorAttribute makes it easy to plug in these enhancements without modifying the core logic of the PropertyGrid.
